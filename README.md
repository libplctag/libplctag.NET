This project is split into two parts
1. A bare-bones native binary [import library](https://github.com/timyhac/libplctag.NET/tree/master/NativeImport) that provides cross-platform support.
2. A [minimal layer](https://github.com/timyhac/libplctag.NET/tree/master/Main) that bridges the gap between libplctag's raw tag handles, and a strongly-typed .NET object.
